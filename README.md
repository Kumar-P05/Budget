## Project Update

Please note that the current state of the project is focused on designing the graphical user interface (GUI). The "Bob's Hammer" folder contains all the development files, but it is not formatted or tested. We do not recommend opening it at this time.

Once the first version of the app is created or the project is restructured, the "Bob's Hammer" folder will be removed, and the repository will be professionally managed. However, until then, we will not actively update or create any issues, projects, readme, or wiki pages, as this project is currently in its early stages and not created with intention of commercial use (at this moment).

Please understand that the repository is being used as a backup for development progress on my personal computer. Once the app is ready, I will manage the repository appropriately and provide comprehensive documentation.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as we work towards creating a functional budget management application.
